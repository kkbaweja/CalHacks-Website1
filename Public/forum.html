<h1>Forum</h1>
<p>This page is a forum for users of the website to discuss
<li>Personal Best Practices</li>
<li>Ask for Advice</li>
<li>Meet Like-Minded People</li>
<li>Consult a Professional</li>

<br>Forums rely on user participation to be effective. That is why we are implementing a credit system for the forum. 
When a user replies to another comment they recieve one credit. When a user upvotes another response, they recieve a half credit. 
When a user posts, they lose one credit.
  
<br>We also hope to involve medical health professionals on this website, who will be paid a small amount for each comment they address
on the forum. Medical professionals must apply with a resume and their credentials verfied before they are given this status on the forum.
